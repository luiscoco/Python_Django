# Python a brief introduction to Django

**Django** is a powerful **web framework** for **Python**, ideal for building **web applications** quickly and efficiently

Below, I'll provide you with a couple of simple Django code samples that you can try out in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

## 1. Setting Up a Basic Django Project

First, let's set up a new Django project. You'll need Python and Django installed

You can **install Django** using **pip** if you haven't already:

```
pip install django
```

After installing Django, you can create a new Django project by running:

```
django-admin startproject myproject
```

This command creates a new directory called **myproject** with the basic structure of a Django project

## 2. Running the Development Server

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to start the development server:

```
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver
```
You should see output indicating that the server is running, and you can visit **http://127.0.0.1:8000/** in your browser to see the default Django welcome page

## 3. Creating a Simple View

Let’s create a simple view to return a response

First, open the **views.py** file in the myproject directory under the myproject application

You might need to create it if it's not there. Add the following Python code:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
```

## 4. Mapping the View to a URL

To make your view accessible through a URL, you'll need to edit the **urls.py** file in the same directory

Add your view to the URL pattern by modifying the urlpatterns list:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import home  # make sure this import statement is at the top

urlpatterns = [
    path('', home, name='home'),
]
```

Now, when you run your server again and navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**, you should see **"Hello, Django!"** displayed in your browser.

## 5. Setting Up VSCode for Django Development

To make your development experience better in VSCode, you can install the **Python extension by Microsoft**

It provides rich support for Python and Django, including features like IntelliSense, linting, and debugging. Here’s how to set it up:

Open VSCode

Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X

Search for "Python" and install the extension provided by Microsoft

This setup should help you start with Django development in VSCode
